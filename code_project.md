# 265 Code Project (draft)


This code project is an alternative to taking the 3rd midterm exam.
In this project you will select from a list of python based project,
learn how to install and use it, and write a summary about the code.
Details on this later.

You are welcome to suggest your own project, but you will need to
run this by your instructors. We also have our own list, extract
by searching on **ascl.net** for **python**


## Suggested projects

### Fitting

Although our recommended fitting module is curve_fit(), much like
we saw for quad() and solve_ivp() they are based on a long history
of robust code developed in other languages (mostly Fortran, IDL and C/C++)

- geneology: LMFIT (original MINPACK-1), MPFIT (IDL), cmpfit (), pycmpfit (python)
