# 265 Code Project (draft)


This code project is an alternative to taking the 3rd midterm exam.
In this project you will select a (python based) open source project.
You will need to learn how to install and use it, and produce
a summary about the code, show some results and some figures to illustrate
your finding.

You are welcome to suggest your own project, but you will need to
run this by your instructors first. We also have our own list, listed
below.

## Writeup

It is your task to evaluate a software package.
Some packages may not work well on windows, and only on mac or linux. Some
requires a lot of extra software, which make it too complex to install,
or require a supercomputer.  Select something

Some questions to answer:

- how old is the package?
- is it still maintained, and by the original authors?
- is it pure python? or does it need a c/C++/fortran library?
- does it install via the "standard" pip/conda, or is it complex?
- what is the input to the package? Just parameters, or dataset(s)?
- what is the output of the package? Just parameters, or dataset(s)?

## Suggested projects

### 1. Fitting

Although our recommended fitting module is curve_fit(), much like
we saw for quad() and solve_ivp() they are based on a long history
of robust code developed in other languages (mostly Fortran, IDL and C/C++).

- geneology: LMFIT (original MINPACK-1), MPFIT (IDL), cmpfit (), pycmpfit (python)

Your task is to find the python equivalent of MPFIT or LMFIT, and compare this
to curve_fit().

Your instructors may give you a dataset to fit and compare.

### 2. Browsing "python" on ascl.net


This list is derived from https://ascl.net/code/search/python

may well disappear in the final version.
